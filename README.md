# ProjectAgent
Capstone Project

This is a capstone project for my master degree, and it is sponsored by LIMRA.

I cannot provide any data or model here.

So this repository will contain only about how I build the web application for analysis the results.

And this is the site:
senlyu.com/projectAgent.html

# Project Stucture
Page1.html: a form post to page2.php
Page2.php: call main.py to run the model results and use the results to show in the page.

Used js: 

1. charts.js(for make the radar chart and pie chart)

2. jquery.usmap.js(for make the US map chart)
